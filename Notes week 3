1. look for candidates: 
if take fresh grads, php n web are most commoon
for grads who did final year project, if want to pass easily, ionic is easier.
those who did android project, are usually the 10% - 15% top because its harder.
it takes 3 weeks to teach ionic, 2 months to teach android

2. for startups, to prove MVP, go hybrid, proof of concept, then get funds, and go native

3. hybrid initial cost is higher, maintenance cost is higher because the language/ framework keeps on changing, and you need to keep on changing your codes. unlike native, native updates is about once a year, and the updates don't break the codes.

4. startups usually start with hybrid, then they will switch to native.

5. FOr iOS, anything that will cause user data to lost, like "Delete" button, it must be red. ROle: Destructive.
ROle is not important for Android, important for iOS.

6. FOr Android, after you have published your app on PLayStore, Google will screen your app. Might get removed by PlayStore.
